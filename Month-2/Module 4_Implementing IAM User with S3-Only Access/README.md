# Module 4_Implementing IAM User with S3-Only Access

## Introduction
In every cloud environment, managing who has access to specific resources is a fundamental aspect of maintaining security and operational control. AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) provides a centralized way to create and manage users, groups, and permissions securely. With IAM, administrators can define precise access boundaries using policies that enforce the principle of least privilege, granting each user only the permissions necessary to perform their job.
In this project, you will learn how to create a new IAM user and configure access control using AWS policies. Specifically, the user will have permission to access Amazon S3 only, while being restricted from interacting with other AWS services. This hands-on implementation demonstrates how IAM policies, roles, and permissions work together to protect cloud resources and prevent unauthorized access.

## Statement of the Problem
In many organizations, multiple team members need access to different AWS services to perform their roles. However, giving every user full administrative access increases the risk of accidental changes, data leaks, or security breaches. For example, a user who only needs to upload files to an S3 bucket should not have permissions to terminate EC2 instances or modify network configurations.
Without proper IAM configuration, organizations face challenges such as:

- Excessive permissions leading to potential misuse or accidental damage.
- Lack of access segregation, making auditing and monitoring difficult.
- Increased vulnerability to insider threats and compromised credentials.
  
To address these issues, AWS IAM enables fine-grained access management, allowing administrators to define exactly what each user can and cannot do. This project demonstrates how to implement such restricted access by creating an IAM user with S3-only permissions.

## Project Objectives
- Understand the core concepts of AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM).
- Learn how to create IAM users and roles.
- Apply the principle of least privilege in granting permissions.
- Configure and attach IAM policies to restrict user access to specific AWS services.
- Create an IAM user with permissions limited to Amazon S3 operations only.
- Test the new IAM user by logging in and verifying access limitations.



## Project Steps

Step 1: Create a new IAM user named s3-only-user with console access.

Step 2: Create S3OnlyAccessPolicy for S3-only permissions and assign to the user

Step 3: Log in as the IAM user, test S3 access, and confirm other services are blocked.

## Project Implementation

### Step 1: Create a New IAM User (s3-only-user)
The first step is to create the IAM user who will use AWS. This user will have their own login credentials and must be created before any permissions can be assigned.

- Open IAM from AWS Console.

- Click Users → Add user.

- Enter username: s3-only-user
- Under Access type, select:
  - AWS Management Console access
- Set a custom or autogenerated password.
- Click Next (do NOT assign permissions yet).
- Click next, next then Create user to finish.

### Step 2: Attach S3-Only Permissions (No JSON Needed)
AWS already provides built-in policies, so you don't need to manually write JSON. You just attach the correct managed policy that gives the user access to Amazon S3 only.

- Go to Users → select s3-only-user

- Click Permissions tab

Click Add permissions → Attach policies directly

- Search for:
  - AmazonS3FullAccess
    
- Select the policy

- Click next and Add permissions

### Step 3: Test the User (Confirm S3 Only)
Now you verify the configuration by logging in as the restricted user. The user should be able to open S3 successfully, but other AWS services must be blocked.

- Log out of Admin account.

- Log back in using:
  - Account ID
  - Username: s3-only-user
  - Password: (the one you set)

- Navigate to S3 → confirm access works.

- Now try visiting EC2 or IAM

You should see an Access Denied message.

✅ This confirms the restriction is working.

## Conclusion
Implementing an IAM user with S3-only access is a practical demonstration of the principle of least privilege, which is one of the core pillars of cloud security. By granting access only to the specific service the user needs — in this case, Amazon S3 — you reduce the risk of accidental misconfigurations, unauthorized operations, or security breaches in other parts of your AWS environment.
Through this project, you have successfully:
•	Created a dedicated IAM user for restricted use,
•	Assigned appropriate predefined AWS permissions without writing custom policies,
•	Verified that access is limited strictly to S3, with all other services blocked.
This approach ensures better accountability, enhances security posture, and maintains clear separation of duties within your AWS infrastructure. As your organization or project grows, the same technique can be extended to create role-specific users for EC2, RDS, CloudWatch, and more — each with appropriately scoped permission.
